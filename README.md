# Obraz
Obraz was originally designed to be the successor of The Meme Bible 1.0's meme-handling systems. We could not afford to maintain a server for this program, so we have released it to the public.

# Installation
The only required dependency for Obraz is the Express Web Application Framework. Other than that, the only thing that is required is information in the memes.json file and memes in the cdn/memes folder.

# Adding a meme
Adding a meme is relatively simple:
1. Add the meme to the cdn/memes folder. Make sure that the name is numbered (e.g. if previous meme is 5.jpg, then change filename of new meme to 6.png) 
2. Add the meme to the memes.json file. Just add it to the end of the memeAuthors array.
